   way to do this.

    * Added a `require`-able library that injects the generator into RDoc's known
    generator hash.
    * Modified method anchors to be the method name instead of a random number --
    this will break URLs generated by RDoc, but I'd rather have sensible URLs.
    * Added a javascript hook that highlights the current page target if there is one.
    * Updated jQuery to 1.2.4

    with other RDoc generators.
