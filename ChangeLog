   Changed: lib/darkfish-rdoc.rb

   Added:   lib/rdoc/generator

   Changed: Rakefile
            lib/darkfish-rdoc.rb
   Deleted: lib/rdoc/generators

   Beginning conversion to Rdoc 2.0. Broken for now; see tags/RDOC_1 for a working
   RDoc 1.x version.

   Added:   darkfish_preview.png (new)
            lib/darkfish-rdoc.rb (new)
   Changed: README
            /trunk

            lib/rdoc/generators/template/darkfish/classpage.rhtml
            lib/rdoc/generators/darkfish_generator.rb (and 2 other/s)

    * Added a `require`-able library that injects the generator into RDoc's known
    generator hash.
    * Modified method anchors to be the method name instead of a random number --
    this will break URLs generated by RDoc, but I'd rather have sensible URLs.
    * Added a javascript hook that highlights the current page target if there is one.
    * Updated jQuery to 1.2.4

    with other RDoc generators.
