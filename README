= Darkfish Rdoc Generator

This is a complete replacement for the default HTML generator for Rdoc. 

I created it with a few goals in mind:

* Replace the four-frame layout with three different indexes with a single-page, 
  class/module-focused view.

* I helped write what became the default look and feel for Rdoc, but it's 
  starting to show its age. I wanted to update it with new CSS and Javascript 
  for modern browsers.

* Add some of the nifty searching and index-on-the-side stuff I liked from the
  modified Allison template (<URL:http://www.superalloy.nl/blog/?p=7>) Eloy 
  Duran came up with.

* Implemented using ERB templates instead of Rdoc's constants-in-a-module style 
  templating.

I think I mostly succeeded, and it's nice enough that I wanted to use it for all
my documentation, and I thought you might want to, too. Or at least be able to
tweak it to generate your own spiffy docs.

It looks like this:

== Getting Started

If you haven't installed it yet, you can install it via RubyGems:

 $ sudo gem install darkfish-rdoc

Or download the source and do:
	
 $ sudo rake install

== Usage

To use it, just specify that you want 'darkfish' output instead of the default
when you run Rdoc:

 $ rdoc -w 4 -SHN -f darkfish -m README README lib

Or from a Rakefile:

  ### Task: rdoc
  require 'rake/rdoctask'
  gem 'darkfish-rdoc'

  Rake::RDocTask.new do |rdoc|
    rdoc.title    = "My Awesome SnoCone Library"
  
    rdoc.options += [
        '-w', '4',
        '-SHN',
        '-f', 'darkfish', # This bit
        '-m', 'README',
      ]
    
    rdoc.rdoc_files.include 'README'
    rdoc.rdoc_files.include 'lib/snocone.rb'
  end
  
  
That's it.

I'd be happy to have feedback via email <URL: mailto:ged at FaerieMUD dot org> or a ticket on
