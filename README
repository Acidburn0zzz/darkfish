= Darkfish Rdoc Generator

This is a complete replacement for the default HTML generator for Rdoc. 

I created it with a few goals in mind:

* Replace the four-frame layout with three different indexes with a single-page, 
  class/module-focused view.

* I helped write what became the default look and feel for Rdoc, but it's 
  starting to show its age. I wanted to update it with new CSS and Javascript 
  for modern browsers.

* Add some of the nifty searching and index-on-the-side stuff I liked from the
  modified Allison template (<URL:http://www.superalloy.nl/blog/?p=7>) Eloy 
  Duran came up with.

* Implemented using separate ERB template files instead of Rdoc's 
  constants-in-a-module style templating.

I think I mostly succeeded, and it's nice enough that I wanted to use it for all
my documentation, and I thought you might want to, too. Or at least be able to
tweak it to generate your own spiffy docs.

It looks like this:

== Getting Started

If you haven't installed it yet, you can install it via RubyGems:

 $ sudo gem install darkfish-rdoc

Or download the source and do:
	
 $ sudo rake install

== Usage

Because of the way Rdoc and Rubygems work, there's currently no way to make the
Darkfish generator available to Rdoc from the command line 'rdoc' tool if you 
have it installed as a gem, but if you install it as a regular Ruby library 
(via 'rake install'), you can do this:

 $ rdoc -w 4 -SHN -f darkfish -m README README lib

I'm trying to figure out how to resolve this for the gem. Suggestions welcomed.

You can, however, load the formatter as a gem from a Rakefile before you define 
the RDocTask:

  ### Task: rdoc
  require 'rake/rdoctask'
  gem 'darkfish-rdoc' # Omit this if it's installed as a regular library
  require 'darkfish-rdoc'

  Rake::RDocTask.new do |rdoc|
    rdoc.title    = "My Awesome SnoCone Library"
  
    rdoc.options += [
        '-w', '4',
        '-SHN',
        '-f', 'darkfish', # This bit
        '-m', 'README',
      ]
    
    rdoc.rdoc_files.include 'README'
    rdoc.rdoc_files.include 'lib/snocone.rb'
  end
  
  
That's it.
